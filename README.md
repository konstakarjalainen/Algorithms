# Data Structures and Algorithms 2

bellman - Bellman-Ford algorithm to find shortest paths and negative cycles

bipartite - Bipartite matching to find maximum number of pairs in two groups connected with edges

mp - Morris-Pratt algorithm for finding pattern in text

mst - Minimum spanning tree algorithm

pairs - Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find all shortest paths from one node to others

qsort - 3-way quick sort for strings

segtree - Segment tree for interval sum queries and value updates

topcycle - Topological order or cycle detection

Note: All selections that should be random are implemented to select middle value due to automatic tests.
